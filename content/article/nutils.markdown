Nutils
======

This is a tricky memo. I asked groups for [this](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/browse_thread/thread/4584ded70ebaa6fb).

Mainly usage is install nutils gem and just put `require "nutils"` into `lib/default.rb`. Really neat.

[This is a link](/nutils/) which was compiled from `src` directory.

You can learn about other Nutils feature [its repo](https://github.com/arnau/Nutils/tree/master/sandbox).

So thank you again [arnau](https://github.com/arnau) and [Dennis](https://github.com/ddfreyne)!
